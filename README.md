### üß† RAM Monitor ‚Äì Bash Script for Memory Usage Alert

This Bash script is designed to monitor the available RAM on a Linux system in real-time. It fetches the total free memory using the `free` command and parses the output with `awk`.

This tool is especially helpful for system administrators, DevOps engineers, or anyone managing servers and virtual machines where keeping an eye on resource usage is crucial.

#### üîß Features:

* Monitors total free memory (`MB`) using `free -mt`
* Customizable memory threshold value
* Displays a warning when memory is low
* Lightweight and easy to integrate into cron jobs or automation scripts

#### üõ†Ô∏è Usage:

```bash
bash ram-monitor.sh
```

You can also schedule it with a cron job to receive regular RAM health checks.
